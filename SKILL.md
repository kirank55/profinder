  Find sparse developer-tool and infrastructure seats by niching the stack
  first, then generating positions, naming incumbents with URL plus quote,
  and scoring occupancy density. Use when asked to find, hunt, or propose
  product seats, including broad "SaaS idea" or "something to build"
  prompts -- those must be grilled into a named stack and host before
  generation or search; do not invent a niche. Abort if the request is
  people-search (GitHub profiles, freelancers, professors). Do not use
  this skill to rate an already-chosen idea when an idea-rater is the
  requested job.

# Profinder

Propose and document vacant developer-tool / infrastructure seats. Score
**occupancy**, not pain. Pain is abundant. Empty seats are not.

## Constraints (every run)

- No repo writes by default.
- Do not score from memory. Load the cited reference file or emit `NEED_EVIDENCE`.
- No overall `/100`.
- Never inline rubric tables into `SKILL.md`.
- Load references **on demand by step**, not as a mandatory full stack. Do not load [intake.md](references/intake.md) unless step 2 needs the scope gate. Do not load [seat-generation.md](references/seat-generation.md) or [search-playbook.md](references/search-playbook.md) before that gate passes. Do not load [search-playbook.md](references/search-playbook.md) before a seat exists. Do not load [calibration.md](references/calibration.md) unless a label is on a boundary (bundle vs slice, claim-kill vs seat-kill, false exact).
- Object is a **stack seat**, never PR hygiene. If the user pastes a PR process question, abort that object.
- User-supplied niche, unique data, and "nobody does this" scope generation. They are not occupancy evidence and do not replace incumbent URLs.

## Procedure

1. **Abort checks.** People-finder (GitHub profiles, freelancers, professors) -> stop; wrong skill, do not reuse these references. Request is "rate this idea / ADR" -> that is a rater job: hand off to an idea-rating skill or workflow; optionally continue only as restatement of a seat into a candidate card, never as a rater verdict.

2. **Choose entry / scope gate.** A slogan is not a seat. Do not generate or search until the object is a named stack position.
   - User named a seat or pasted an ADR/idea that already restates without slogans -> go to step 4 (restate). Do not load intake.
   - User named a seat but `v1_as_shipped` or host is missing -> load [intake.md](references/intake.md) (named-seat branch), ask only those blanks, then step 4. Do not search until restatable.
   - User asked to find / hunt / propose seats -> load [intake.md](references/intake.md). If the niche card is incomplete and the user did not opt out, emit the intake card and **stop**. Do not load seat-generation or search-playbook. Do not invent a niche.
   - Hunt with a filled niche, or explicit "pick a stack" opt-out -> load [seat-generation.md](references/seat-generation.md), produce >=5 raw seats **inside that niche**, then map steps 3-8 over each.

3. **Deny check.** Load [deny-patterns.md](references/deny-patterns.md). If the target workspace keeps a local deny file, that file wins (`deny_catalog: local_adr_0001`). Else use the embedded fallback (`deny_catalog: embedded_baseline`). If both missing, `deny_catalog: incomplete` and do not emit an `as_company` keep.

4. **Restate.** One-line `candidate_seat`, concrete `v1_as_shipped`, named process or protocol, stack substrate. Copy `niche` from intake (named-seat path may derive it from the restatement; `source: user`). If this cannot be stated without slogans ("AI developer productivity"), drop the seat.

5. **Steelman ceiling.** Strongest case a skeptical founder would still build this. Occupancy ceiling 0-10 **before** search. Published `exact_mechanics_density` must not exceed this ceiling unless new named incumbent rows appear.

6. **Search incumbents.** Load [search-playbook.md](references/search-playbook.md). Collect >=5 incumbents, each with name, verified URL, exact quote, seat-match label, leftover. 404 or unverified fetch -> that row is `NEED_EVIDENCE`; do not invent.

7. **Seat-match + dual-score.** Load [seat-match.md](references/seat-match.md) then [rubric.md](references/rubric.md). One label per incumbent; strictest mismatch wins. `problem_density` counts `adjacent_pain`; `exact_mechanics_density` counts `exact` only and must be <= steelman ceiling.

8. **Gates.** Apply auto-rejects and falsification from [rubric.md](references/rubric.md). Load [calibration.md](references/calibration.md) only if needed to break a tie on a boundary case.

9. **Emit** the candidate card from [output-template.md](references/output-template.md), including the `niche` block. Split `as_company` / `as_oss` / `as_plugin`. Set `file_on` when the honest leftover is a flag, PR, or plugin. Do not emit a headline rater decision (that belongs to a rater, not the finder). Finder disposition is the split verdicts plus `file_on` plus `claim_hygiene`. Do not emit this card when step 2 stopped on `intake_blocked`.
