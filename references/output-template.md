# Output template (finder candidate card)

Headline is a **candidate**, not a rater decision. No overall `/100`. Do not emit a headline rater verdict (that belongs to a rater, not the finder).

Do not emit this card when the scope gate failed. That path emits the niche card in [intake.md](intake.md) only. `niche` here is copied from a passed gate (or derived on a named-seat restatement). Unique data is copied verbatim; it does not move density scores.
