# Deny patterns

Short catalog of collapse modes. Not a substitute for a full killed-seats table. A previous kill is a deny-list entry, not a scoring template (prior-kill-as-rubric): do not condense another project's killed-seats tables into this file as the working catalog.

## Local deny file (optional)

If the target workspace keeps its own killed-seats file (for example `docs/adr/0001-no-pitchable-candidate.md`), its tables are authoritative (`deny_catalog: local_adr_0001`). Confirm the candidate's one-line seat against those rows before scoring; a match stops the run with a pointer to that row.

If no such file exists, use the embedded baseline below (`deny_catalog: embedded_baseline`). A hunt-local killed-seats write-up under `.docs/` or `docs/` that tables one-line seats counts as a local deny file.

`deny_catalog: incomplete` only if neither a local deny file nor this fallback is available. That is not the happy path.

Intake `hard_nos` are generation filters. They are not deny-catalog rows and do not Occupied-score a seat by themselves.

## Collapse modes

1. **File it on the incumbent.** Named product already *is* the headline UX (silo for loopback isolation; ntfy `--wait-cmd` for silent local jobs).
2. **Add the missing ecosystem to Veln** (or Pixi, OpenTofu, ntfy, cachelens, Electric, Cursor, ...). Cross-ecosystem absence is not a company.
3. **Sidecar without host runtime enforcement.** Third-party lockfile, PATH wrap, or controller the platform does not consult (`tofulock`, `pio-lock`, `red-widow`). Real engineering, not a company.

## Embedded fallback (use when no local deny file exists)

Treat as closed unless a **mechanical** gap appears that the write-up missed:

- Phone notifiers for local/CI tasks (ntfy, Pushover)
- Localhost tunnels and OAuth companions (ngrok, Cloudflare named tunnels, Dev Tunnels)
- Worktree loopback isolation (silo)
- Sidecar locks without host enforcement

Fuller aisles (same rule -- closed unless a mechanical gap appears): advisory prompt-cache inspectors, vendor API contract drift seats, universal offline SQL mutation upcast (non-invertible; reject), PTY secret reverse-map (confused deputy; reject), agent sandbox / FS / secrets / MCP wraps the host already ships, package-manager-shaped lock/integrity seats the platform absorbed, GitHub merge-queue packaging (`cancel-in-progress`, systemd job quotas, `npm ci` lock-vs-image drift Action, Trunk impacted-target parallel lanes, harden-runner job-ID egress ledger, Trunk flaky-test quarantine), npm/Node PATH enforcement packaging (lifecycle net sandbox wrapping `bwrap` + lavamoat, Volta/fnm engines interlock, lavamoat `--experimental-bins` lockfile PATH gate, npm `prefix` redirector, `NODE_OPTIONS` allowlist wrapper), Redis RESP sidecar packaging (ACL-bridging firewall, Envoy per-command fault injection, prefix dual-write/RedisShake, MONITOR/Software audit OTel tap, Envoy `ReadPolicy` lag router), rustc/cargo packaging (sccache ledger, cargo-auditable/cyclonedx SBOM, cargo-deny/bloat duplicate gate, cargo-geiger unsafe allowlist, `cargo vendor` airgap mirror), kernel/eBPF packaging that is not Landlock-loopback (cgroup freezer-budget, fapolicyd lockfile exec-allowlist, BPF-LSM/AppArmor repo interlock, io_uring `SystemCallFilter`, scx_layered latency scheduler, Tetragon/Tracee/Falco OTel provenance).

## Priors are not a rubric

A previous kill is a deny-list entry, not a scoring template. Do not use closed-aisle leftovers as generation seeds. Re-search **this** seat. Name **this** seat's incumbents. Seat-match those rows.

Closed Occupied aisles from this hunt loop (see `.docs/killed-seats.md` for one-line seats):
